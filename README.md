# Awesome Folia

[Folia](https://papermc.io/software/folia) is a fork of [Paper](https://papermc.io/software/paper) that divides the
world into separate regions, each running on its own thread.
This significantly improves performance by utilizing more CPU cores.
Since a standard Minecraft world can only use one thread, Folia allows for much larger worlds with more players, making
it perfect for big servers like SMPs or SkyBlock.

However, many plugins are designed to run on a single thread and, as a result, won't work on Folia.
This list aims to highlight plugins and projects specifically made, optimized, or targeted for Folia servers,
developers, and administrators.
The goal is to bring attention to both these projects and to Folia itself.

_This list is inspired by [BlockhostOfficial/folia-plugins](https://github.com/BlockhostOfficial/folia-plugins),
which has been unmaintained for a while._
